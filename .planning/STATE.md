# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build bottom-up following dependency chain (SDK POC -> Config/State -> Step Runner -> Verifiers -> Phase Runner -> Pipeline -> CLI -> Enhancements)
- [Roadmap]: SDK POC is Phase 1 (non-negotiable) due to 6+ API divergences between SPEC.md and real SDK
- [Roadmap]: Requirements gathering and UAT deferred to Phase 8 (enhancement layer) per research recommendation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SDK V2 preview API (`unstable_v2_createSession`) is labeled unstable and may change before Forge ships
- `bypassPermissions` + `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` behavior needs live validation in Phase 1
- `maxBudgetUsd` is "a target rather than a strict limit" for extended thinking -- budget overrun characteristics unknown
